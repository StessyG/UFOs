# UFOs
# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a straightforward user experience of the UFO sightings that allows users to filter the data using multiple criteria such as city, state, country, shape and date at the same time.
The original webpage was built using HTML and Javascript, and tables were added to display the filters.

# Results

.With the newly added filters, the users are able to filter the data using a single criterion as shown in the example below.
- Filter by city
![Filter_2](https://github.com/StessyG/UFOs/blob/568c00d688efc0e5aa81b2e7d2cd3dde4f9243a8/static/images/Filter_2.png)
.Users can also use multiple criteria simultaneously for precise results.
![Filter_1](https://github.com/StessyG/UFOs/blob/10e8ec4655d140382939140769637030aebdeffe/static/images/Filter_1.png)

# Summary

. One drawback of this new design is the user has to be aware of the city, state, shape, country or date they are searching for. The user needs to analyze the table and know the element they are looking for, before using the filters.
. The first recommendation would be to add dropdowns with the options available for an easier user experience.
. The second recommendtion would be to add a function that allows special characters such as Upper case, or spaces at the end.
